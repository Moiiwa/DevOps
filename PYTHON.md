**Best practices used in project**  
* **Flask**  
To develop an app I decided to use flask, since it is the easiest web-framework for python
which doesn't need you to put a lot of effort in order to run single-page app.  
* **Figma** 
1) *Figma itself*  
In order to develop design for a webpage I decided to use Figma, since it has a lot of
plugins and design options, [link to design](https://www.figma.com/file/drJMJah08WyQvD41hwgH6S/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).
2) *Figma "HtmlGenerator" plugin*  
This plugin is useful to transfer your design from figma directly to html and css, which is 
extremely useful if you appreciate spending time only on things that can not be done automatically.
* **Javascript**  
It's not a secret, that in order to add any logic to your webpage you need to use JS,
I've written a simple script, which can be found in html itself. That script gets current time for Moscow each second and updates the field with time.
* **P.S.**  
For code readability I simply used pycharm hotkeys for code style correction.
