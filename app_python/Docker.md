**Best practices with Docker**

* As a basic image "ubuntu:18.04" was taken since it's stable and has shown it's usefulness with time. Also I personally just don't like ubuntu 20.04.
* In order to simplify import of libraries "requirements.txt" with list of required packages 
was used.
* Also it is easy to find almost ready Dockerfile instructions for flask app 
in google, so I just used it.
